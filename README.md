    This is a game I am developing inspired by Dune! It will hopefully be a mix of Dune and Temple Run. This is for education purposes.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Having watched Denis Villeneuve's take on Dune in Dune Part 1 and Part 2 was very inspiring.  The vast deserts of Arrakis seemed otherwordly and real. Moreover, having read Dune and Dune Messiah, the rise and fall of Paul has shaped my perspective on science fiction and literature. After consuming my dosage of this amazing story, I thought it would be an excellent way for me to apply and learn computer graphics while creating something relevant to an universe I am fascinated by. Hence this project is aimed at creating a Dune inspired game with stylized graphics. For the art style, I am hoping to achieve something similar to Sonic Unleashed. In terms of gameplay, it will be based on Temple Run as the primary concern will be programming an engine with modern computer graphics practices and not game design as much. The environment will of course be based on Dune.
